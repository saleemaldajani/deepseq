,B cell,Monocyte,T cell,Natural killer (NK) cell,"The top marker genes for cluster_3, including IL7R, NGFRAP1, RGCC, ZNF141, RPS29, PILRB, PASK, PDCD4-AS1, C14orf64, and DENND2D, suggest that this cluster most likely represents memory T cells. IL7R (Interleukin-7 receptor alpha) is notably expressed on memory T cells, playing a crucial role in their survival and homeostasis.
